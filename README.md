A repository for my backend development course at Techcrush

# Techcrush Backend Learnings 🚀

This repository contains all the backend practice projects, mini assignments, and experiments I completed as part of my learning journey at **Techcrush**.

It includes everything from basic CRUD APIs to more advanced features like authentication, email sending, file uploads, and working with CMS tools like Strapi.

Each folder is self-contained with its own setup, dependencies, and usage guide (where necessary).

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Node.js / Express**
- **MongoDB / MySQL**
- **JWT Authentication**
- **RESTful API Design**
- **File Uploads**

## 📌 Notes

- These are **learning-focused** projects and may include extra logging, comments, and alternative methods for educational purposes.
- Environment variables are required for some projects — example files (`.env.example`) are included where needed.

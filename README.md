A repository for my backend development course at Techcrush

# Techcrush Backend Learnings 🚀

This repository contains all the backend practice projects, mini assignments, and experiments I completed as part of my learning journey at **Techcrush**.

It includes everything from basic CRUD APIs to more advanced features like authentication, email sending, file uploads, and working with CMS tools like Strapi.

Each folder is self-contained with its own setup, dependencies, and usage guide (where necessary).
